**STAND-ALONE EXECUTABLE FOR NON-DEVS -** 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cPCp5a9A2-YMs7w7P5K3djtAqH7ePnTM *(~59mb)*

**WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS -** Unzip and open SoundCloud.exe inside the SoundCloud folder _(It's located near the bottom)_                 

**MAC INSTRUCTIONS -** Currently, there is no executable that is compatible with Mac. Although if you're tech savvy, you can clone the repository and run it using the instructions provided below for devs :)  

_The icon is different but once you open it, the SoundCloud logo will appear in your taskbar_

**NOTE -** Currently, the app refreshes your status every 10-15 seconds, which means when you switch songs it may not change instantly. This is not a bug, **_this is a feature_**

**KNOWN BUGS**
- Not having your SoundCloud language set to English will cause the application to keep your status stuck on "Currently Browsing"

**SETUP FOR DEVS -** Clone and navigate to the directory in CMD and run 
```npm install```
then
```npm start``` _(node.js required)_

_Feel free to add me if you have any questions_

**PLANNED FEATURES**
- Song art support - As it stands now, there is no possible way to achieve this with what's been offered to developers
- Song progress bar - I got one of my high-IQ boys back home working on this feature as we speak
- Listen with friends - Again, this is currently not possible, although there is still hope for the future
- Song permalink - Either have the image or song name an actual link to the song
- Change "Playing" to "Listening to"
