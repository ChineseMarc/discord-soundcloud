**INSTRUCTIONS -** Unzip and open SoundCloud.exe inside the SoundCloud folder _(It's located near the bottom)_

**NOTE -** Currently, the app refreshes your status every 10-15 seconds, which means when you switch songs it may not change instantly. This is not a bug, **_this is a feature_**

**SETUP FOR DEVS -** Clone and navigate to the directory in CMD and run 
```npm install```
then
```npm start``` _(node.js required)_

**PLANNED FEATURES**
- Song art support - As it stands now, there is no possible way to achieve this with what's been offered to developers
- Song progress bar - I got one of my high-IQ boys back home working on this feature as we speak
- Listen with friends - Again, this is currently not possible, although there is still hope for the future
- Song permalink - Either have the image or song name an actual link to the song
